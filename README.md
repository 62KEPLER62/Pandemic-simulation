# Pandemic-simulation
Pandemic simulation with javascript
This is a simple pandemix simulation that I made using javascript.
The graphics are made with javascript canvas and css.
The graph on the bottom of the page shows the number of infected and healthy people and is also drawn with javascript canvas.

*IMPORTANT*
The optimal value for infection duration parameter is between 300 and 1000,
less than this can cause immediate vanishing artificial humans and the simulation cannot be succeed.
