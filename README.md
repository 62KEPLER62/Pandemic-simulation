# Pandemic-simulation
Pandemic simulation with javascript
This is a simple pandemix simulation that I made using javascript.
The graphics are made with javascript canvas and css.

*IMPORTANT*
The optimal value for infection duration parameter is between 300 and 1000,
less than this can cause immediate vanishing artificial humans and the simulation cannot be succeed.
